This project is an API built using **Java, Java Spring, MySQL, and the H2 database**.

The API was developed to study and improve my knowledge in Java and its technologies. This project simulates a cafeteria system, where you can order pizzas, hamburgers and drinks. As you can see, it keeps receiving updates and improvements.
